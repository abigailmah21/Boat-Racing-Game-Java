# Boat-Racing-Game-Java
Boat Racing Game is a Java-based project created as part of an Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals course. It is a two-player game where players race their boats along a 100-column river filled with traps and currents. This game resembles to that of a snake-and-ladder game, with the traps as snakes, and the currents as ladders. 

# How the Game Works
* Players take turn to throw the dice, which indicates the number of steps the boat moves forward in the river.
* The river is essentially a 100-columns track filled with random number of traps and currents.
* All traps and currents are scattered randomly in the river when the game starts.
* If the boat hits a:
  - Trap: Boat moves backwards x number of steps
  - Current: Boat moves forward x number of steps
* The first player who reaches the 100th-column wins the game.
* The Top 5 players with the highest score are displayed on the scoreboard.
